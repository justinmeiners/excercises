; EXCERCISE
; Give an example of a relation which is neither reflexive or strict

; In other words, it holds sometimes for the same things, and sometimes not

; 1. having a positive sum
; R(-2, -2) = false
; R(2, 2) = true

; 2. Insulted
; R(bob, bob) bob insulted himself
; ~R(john, john) john did not insult himself
; R(bob, john) bob insulted john

; NOTES

; I was confused by the definition of relation in the book.
;  I learned it as a cartesian product of sets, with the function being a special subset of this.
; Alex defines it is a binary predicate. The key here is that the predicate is used to define membership of the sets.
; Mathematicians like sets, predicates are more compact for computers.

; a related to b iff (a, b) \in M
; a related to b iff R(a, b) is true
