# SICP Excercies

My solutions to excercies from my favorite programming book [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html).

You can also find a nice reformatted version [here](https://github.com/sarabander/sicp-pdf).

These excercises are not complete. I also often modified them rather than sticking to the original problems. When I got stuck I often looked at [Ivan's Solutions](https://github.com/ivanjovanovic/sicp)

I used [Chicken Scheme](https://call-cc.org)
