# eop-excercises

This repo contains my solutions to excercises from [Elements of Programming](http://elementsofprogramming.com). As typical for me, my goal is not to achieve 100% completeness. I simply want to learn the material better. So, I select excercies that are interesting to me.

I chose to write in Scheme rather than C++, since I think it more purely expresses the computational ideas. This book also relies heavily on [concepts](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concepts) which do not exist yet, and not in the form found in this book.
