        <h3> What is going on? </h3>

        <p>
        Since the system is a closed cycle, it's depicted as a loop.
        The fat section represents the storage tank.
        The section outlined in yellow is the coil being heated by the sun.
        </p>

        <p>
        The two main processes being simulated  are the pump moving water around,
        and conduction between neighboring pieces.
        Energy never leaves the system, so it will keep heating up forever (hit reset).
        </p>

        <p>
            It takes a big solar panel to collect much energy.
            Since this one is small I made the sun 20x stronger than normal.
        </p>

        <h3> Things to Try</h3>

        <ul>
        <li>
            Leave pump at 0 and crank up the temperature to watch the condution.
        </li>
        <li>
            Speed up time and crank up the pump speed.
        </li>
       </ul>


        <h3> Why JavaScript?</h3>

        <p> So I could make this interface and display </p>
       <script src="app.js"></script>
    </body>
